# FlashCard-Generator

The Basic Card Game was made with questions and answers from the json file as originally intended.  I believe the HW demo json file was in error and was actually for the clozed version.

Both the basic and the clozed versions here use a randomizer so the questions come in unique orders each time the game is played. Please see the randomization algorithm which was cited in the code.

Two methods are prototyped in the cloze version.

Lastly, at the end of the questions the user is asked if they want to play again instead of being thrown into another game ad nauseam due to the recursion technique in the getQuestion function.
